# Introduction

## 1.1 Authorization

This report was authorized by the Urban Drainage and Flood Control
District (UDFCD) under joint sponsorship with the City of Arvada under
the March 2014 agreement regarding “Major Drainageway Plan for Leyden
Creek”, Agreement No. 14-03.06. Notice to proceed for Agreement No.
14-03.06 with ICON Engineering, Inc. was provided by UDFCD on March 26,
2014. Although not a sponsor, Jefferson County was a significant
stakeholder and participant in this study.

## 1.2 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this study is to provide updated hydrologic information
for Leyden Creek. The watershed is bounded to the south by the Ralston
Creek watershed, to the north by both Big Dry Creek and Little Dry Creek
watersheds. The majority of the Leyden Creek watershed is located within
the City of Arvada with the remaining areas lying within unincorporated
Jefferson County.

The following is a summary of the scope of work for this study:

* Coordinate meetings with UDFCD and project stakeholders

* Obtain and review previously developed hydrologic information

* Review and provide adjustments to land use parameters based on
    obtained land use, zoning maps

* Determine subwatershed boundaries and parameters

* Develop existing and future conditions hydrologic models utilizing
    the UDFCD Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) v.1.4.3
    spreadsheet and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Storm
    Water Management Model (EPA SWMM) v. 5.0.022 for the 2-, 5-, 10-,
    25-, 50-, and 100-year recurrence intervals

## 1.3 Planning Process

The planning process began with reviewing previous studies for the
Leyden Creek watershed. Hydrology was originally developed as part of
Ralston/Leyden Creek Major Drainageway Plan dated September 1977. An
update to the hydrology was completed prior to the Ralston Creek –
Leyden Creek FHAD dated June 2004.

Progress meetings were held to discuss the project status and
methodology with stakeholders. Minutes for all meetings held during the
project can be found in [*APPENDIX A - Project Correspondence*](#).

**March 20, 2014 Project Kickoff Meeting**: The project sponsors were
introduced and identified. An introduction to the project to understand
goals for the Leyden Creek Major Drainageway Plan was provided.

**May 5, 2014 Progress Meeting**: The project status was presented. This
meeting reviewed land use within the watershed and approach for
detention, including Leyden Lake. Follow up questions regarding the
lake’s outlet elevations resulted in survey being completed by the City
of Arvada’s surveyors.

**August 13, 2014 Hydrology Review / Alternative Kick-Off Meeting**:
Comments provided by the public and project sponsors were reviewed. The
project team reviewed the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis
System (HEC-RAS) model that will be utilized during the project. Key
locations within the watershed were discussed for possible alternatives.

**September 24, 2014 Croke Canal Alternative Analysis:** The project
team met with a representative from the Farmers Reservoir and Irrigation
Canal Company (FRICO) to discuss alternatives for the Leyden Creek
crossing with the Croke Canal.

**December 1, 2014 Alternative Analysis Progress Meeting:** The project
team discussed alternatives and evaluated which alternatives best
matched the project goals.

**January 27, 2015 Citizen’s Review Committee Meeting:** The project
team met with three residents of Cameo Estates, Jennie Ridgley, Jonathan
Nelson, and Kevin Klinkerfues to discuss their comments on the DRAFT
Alternative Analysis Report.

**February 17, 2015 Public Meeting**: A public meeting was held at Van
Arsdale Elementary School to discuss the recommended plan and gather
community input.

**September 15, 2015 Conceptual Design Progress Meeting:** The project
team met to discuss the comments on the DRAFT Conceptual Design Report.

## 1.4 Mapping and Surveys

Geographic Information System (GIS) layers were collected from the City
of Arvada and Jefferson County. The layers provided included city and
county boundaries, storm sewer information, zoning and parcel data.

Project mapping was based on regional LiDAR mapping with the following
attributes:

Geographic Area: Colorado, Denver Metropolitan Region  
Coverage: Denver Metropolitan Region, approx. 947 sq. mi.  
Capture Date: Fall 2013 – Spring 2014  
Collection Resolution: 0.7 meter ground sampling distance  
Horizontal Datum: NAD 83  
Vertical Datum: NAVD1988  

A combination of aerial imagery was utilized on the project.
Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) resource center which
provides 0.3 meter resolution within the continental United States was
used along with 1 meter resolution 2012 aerial imaginary provided by
UDFCD.

The City of Arvada survey staff performed a survey on the spillway for
Leyden Lake as part of this study. Based on discussions with project
sponsors, no other structures were surveyed; however ICON completed
field measurements on the Ralston Valley High School and at Lamplighter
Park ponds.

## 1.5 Data Collection

Previous reports for the study area were obtained from multiple sources.
Previous FHAD and MDP reports were obtained through UDFCD’s Electronic
Data Management (EDM) system. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) was
obtained through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website.
The Water and Earth Technologies (WET) reconstruction report and City of
Arvada Comprehensive Plan was accessed from the City of Arvada’s
website. All other documents were provided by project sponsors. Reports
collected are referenced in Table 1-1 below.
