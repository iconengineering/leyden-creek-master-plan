# Alternative Analysis

## 5.1 Alternative Development Process

Following the identification of problem areas, alternatives were
developed in order to mitigate flooding potential and implement the
project goals set forth by project sponsors and local stakeholders.

Three main alternative categories were developed to address the problems
identified in Section 4: Channel Conveyance, Channel Stability, and
Crossing Improvements.

Leyden Lake was also evaluated to restore the facility to contain the
100-year event. The addition of alternate regional detention facilities
were not considered beyond Leyden Lake. Alternatives were reviewed with
project sponsors at periodic project meetings. A separate meeting was
held with staff representing the Croke Canal.

## 5.2 Criteria and Constraints

The design and evaluation of conceptual alternatives was based on the
criteria set forth in the Jefferson County Design and Technical Criteria
Storm Drainage Manual, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual, and City of
Arvada’s Engineering Code of Standards and Specifications.

After discussion with project sponsors, it was determined that any major
roadway crossing and each of the local road crossings in the City of
Arvada would be sized to convey the 100-year discharge. The only local
road crossing, West 75^th^ Place in unincorporated Jefferson County,
would be evaluated based on current county standards. The applicable
county standards considered for West 75^th^ Place in the *Jefferson
County Design and Technical Criteria Storm Drainage Manual* states a
10-year crossing, less than one foot of overtopping on the roadway, and
a maximum headwater depth to culvert size ratio of 1.5.

## 5.3 Alternative Categories

Problem areas within the Leyden Creek watershed fell into several
categories. The categories that applied to multiple problem areas were:
Channel Conveyance, Channel Stabilization, and Bridge/Culvert
alternatives. There were also several categories that were unique to
specific problem area including Culvert/Spill Structure for the canal
crossings, and Detention Alternatives at Leyden Lake. An alternative
feasibility matrix for each problem area can be seen in [Table 5‑1](#).

#### 5.3.1 Channel Conveyance

Channel conveyance alternatives were developed in areas that were
identified to pose flood hazards due to a lack in channel conveyance
capacity. Increasing capacity in these areas will better manage the
flood hazards surrounding buildings and other structures.

#### 5.3.2 Channel Stabilization 

Channel stabilization alternatives were developed to address areas with
potential for future channel degradation and bank erosion. Check
structures have been proposed as a means to control future erosion along
the drainageway. Design channel slopes of 0.6% upstream of Leyden Lake
and 0.45% downstream of Leyden Lake were selected based on a combination
of criteria set forth in *Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual* and
recommendations for the project area based on previous reports.

#### 5.3.3 Bridge / Culverts 

Through discussions with project sponsors, any major roadway crossings,
and all roadway crossings within the City of Arvada were sized to convey
the 100-year flow without overtopping the roadway. The crossing at West
75^th^ Place, within unincorporated Jefferson County would be evaluated
based on county roadway crossing criteria.

Ward Road, located in Reach 2, is planned to extend north from the
intersection with West 72^nd^ Avenue, crossing Leyden Creek between West
75^th^ Avenue and West 75^th^ Place. The current conceptual design for
Ward Road call for a six cell 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC crossing at Leyden
Creek. Since planning for the Ward Road extension is proceeding
independently from this project, separate design alternatives and
project alternative costs have not been included with this plan. The
Ward Road extension also includes extending the trail from Leyden Creek
Park up to Alkire Street with a separate trail underpass for Ward Road,
located south of the Ward Road and Leyden Creek crossing. The trail
crosses underneath of Alkire Street at the proposed new intersection of
Alkire Street and West 78^th^ Circle, separate from Leyden Creek itself.

For these reasons, the trail crossing culverts at the proposed Ward Road
extension and Alkire Street have not been include in the project design
alternatives, as these improvements are offline and in their current
configuration not directly associated with the proposed Leyden Creek
infrastructures needs. Conversely, recreational needs including a
maintenance trail would be considered with the project design
alternatives in areas such as Quaker Street and West 72md Avenue.

#### 5.3.4 Culvert / Spill Structure

Canal crossings were evaluated to develop alternatives to prevent the
damage witnessed in the September 2013 flooding. Representatives for the
canals were contacted to determine their interest in developing
alternatives with the project team. A meeting was held with staff
representing the Croke Canal discussing the preferred alternatives at
the Leyden Creek crossing. Flow limiting structures were discussed to
prevent exceeding the decreed flow of the Croke Canal downstream of the
crossing. Since the Croke Canal requires two feet of freeboard, the
project team decided to develop alternatives for Leyden Creek crossing
underneath the existing Croke Canal. The City of Arvada did not express
interest in having a purge control structure at the crossing so it was
decided a passive weir structure was the best alternative for any type
of flow limiting structure.

The Farmers’ High Line Canal was discussed in relation to alternatives
developed at Leyden Lake. The Farmers’ High Line Canal intercepts any
flows passing over the Leyden Lake emergency spillway. If Leyden Lake
was improved to a 100-year storage facility, there would be no impact on
the Farmers’ High Line Canal, as the principal spillway passes
underneath the canal.

Plans for a new crossing of the Church Ditch at Leyden Creek are also
underway, following the 2013 flood event. Similar to the Ward Road
extension, no additional alternatives were developed for this location.

#### 5.3.5 Detention Alternative

Leyden Lake was evaluated to determine the necessary improvements to
detain the 100-yr storm without overtopping the emergency spillway. The
hydrologic benefits of this improvement were also discussed.

## 5.4 Alternative Hydraulics

Hydraulic analyses were performed to evaluate the benefits and impact of
each alternative. In general, channel conveyance was based on the normal
depth sizes and shapes for cross-sectional areas required to convey the
design discharges. The hydraulic analysis was performed in accordance
with UDFCD, City of Arvada, and Jefferson County criteria. Each
alternative was analyzed separately and inserted into the existing
conditions HEC-RAS v4.1.0 model to gage its impact on the floodplain.

Sizing for roadway box culverts were estimated using the nomographs
found in the USDCM.

EPA SWMM was used to evaluate the hydrology alternative of Leyden Lake.

## 5.5 Alternative Cost Estimates

Cost estimates for alternatives were developed using UDFCD’s master
planning cost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. 2012 unit
costs values were adjusted to present value using the current Colorado
Construction Cost Index report. An inflation rate of 1.0804 was used to
adjust unit costs. A summary of unit costs can be found in [*APPENDIX C -
Hydraulic Analysis*](#).

Effective interest rate was estimated to be 1.50%. This assumption was
made based upon current discount rates from the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and inflation rates published by the US government. These figures
can be found in [*APPENDIX C - Hydraulic Analysis*](#).

Operation and Maintenance was also included within the UD MP Cost
worksheet. Culvert maintenance was assumed to occur once every two
years, with hydraulic structure and channel maintenance performed once
every five years.

Right of way easement costs were calculated using data from the
Jefferson County Assessor’s Office. The easement value was proportioned
from the total assessed property value. If an easement required more
than 50 percent of the property, the entire assessed value was used in
the easement cost.

Other costs were calculated as a percent of Capital Improvement Costs,
such as Engineering, Legal/Administrative, Contract
Administration/Construction Management, and Contingency. No alterations
to the default values provided by the UD-MP Cost spreadsheet were made
to these items.

## 5.6 Alternative Plans

Several different alternative plans were developed to mitigate problem
areas throughout the watershed. One alternative plan, Minimum Crossing
Improvement and Maintenance Alternatives, improves all roadway crossings
to meet current jurisdictional criteria. The second alternative plan,
100-year Conveyance Alternative, improves roadway crossings to convey
100-year flows at all locations and increases channel conveyance
capacity in problem areas. Isolated alternatives were also evaluated for
detention, and slope stabilization. A summary of alternative cost
estimates can be seen in *Table 5‑2* through *Table 5‑4*.

#### 5.6.1 Reach 1

Upstream of the confluence with Ralston Creek to Simms Street, no
alternatives were developed since no flood hazards were identified in
this area. The roadway crossing at Simms Street has adequate capacity to
convey the 100-yr design discharge.

Upstream of Simms Street, alternatives were developed to address the
overtopping at West 72^nd^ Avenue and flooding within the Woodland
Valley Filing No. 3 subdivision along with the undersized roadway
crossing at West 72^nd^ Avenue. Both alternatives address the inundation
of structures caused by the split flow at West 72^nd^ Avenue.

**Plan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative**  
This alternative will divert flows upstream of West 72^nd^ Avenue using
a 11 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC. This culvert will continue east along West 72^nd^
Avenue, and south through the First Church of Arvada’s parking lot,
prior to discharging back into Leyden Creek just upstream of the Simms
Street crossing. The RCBC is sized for approximately 500 cfs, the flow
estimated to be beyond the current channel capacity downstream of West
72^nd^ Avenue. West 72^nd^ Avenue will also be increased in size to a 70
ft. bridge to convey the remaining 1657 cfs across the roadway.

**Plan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative**  
The 100-yr Conveyance Alternative proposes to improve the roadway
crossing and existing channel to convey the entire 100-year design
discharge along the existing flowpath. This alternative requires
acquiring right of way easements in several properties in the Woodland
Valley Filing No. 3 subdivision as the existing channel doesn’t have the
capacity to convey the 100-year design discharge. The required
right-of-way for these improvements is approximately 90 feet. The West
72^nd^ Avenue Bridge will be increased to a 90 ft. bridge to convey the
entire 100-year discharge of 2157 cfs. Acquiring the right-of-way for
the proposed channel would also increase the area available to
incorporate a future trail and trail underpass, between West 72^nd^
Avenue and the existing trail downstream of Simms Street.

Upstream of West 72^nd^ Avenue, in the Woodland Valley No. 7
subdivision, increasing the existing channel conveyance capacity is
proposed to eliminate the right bank spill flow that currently impacts
residential homes.

#### 5.6.2 Reach 2 

The alternatives developed for Reach 2 proposed to mitigate the
undersized roadway crossings at West 75^th^ Place and Alkire Street
designed to meet criteria identified in Section *5.3.3 Bridge /
Culverts*. There are several structures within the regulatory floodplain
and additional structures in the shallow flooding areas. All
alternatives developed for Reach 2 eliminate the shallow flooding that
flows across Alkire Street.

**Plan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative**  
Double 8 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC’s are proposed beneath West 75^th^ Place to
increase the capacity of the crossing to meet the Jefferson County
criteria. This plan would not be impacted by the Ward Road expansion
since the proposed improvements tie into the existing channel upstream
of the proposed Ward Road crossing.

At Alkire Street, the existing crossing is proposed to be improved as
two 12 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC’s. Channel work is proposed at both locations to
lower the channel upstream and downstream of each crossing. At Alkire
Street, the existing water features upstream of the culvert crossing
will require some degree of reconstruction to accommodate the proposed
channel grades.

**Plan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative**  
This alternative proposes to convey the 100-yr discharge from Alkire
Street to downstream of West 75^th^ Place within a new design channel,
paralleling the existing channel alignment. The new channel will
mitigate 100-year floodplain impacts at existing structures along this
reach and convey 100-year flood flows below both Alkire Street and West
75^th^ Place. The roadway crossing at West 75^th^ Place is proposed to
be improved to double 14 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC to convey the 100-yr discharge
under the roadway. Additional consideration would be needed during
conceptual design to address the proposed channel improvements near the
Ward Road expansion.

**Plan 3: Combination Alternate**  
A third alternative was developed incorporating aspects of both Plan 1
and Plan 2. The proposed crossing structure at Alkire Street and the
proposed channel from Plan 2 are carried forward to Plan 3, but the
crossing at West 75^th^ Place is sized to meet the minimum
jurisdictional criteria conveying the 10-year discharge. By downsizing
the culvert at West 75^th^ Place to meet the minimum local road
jurisdictional criteria, the proposed channel downstream of West 75^th^
Place requires less disturbance to property owners by tying into the
existing channel grade in less distance than Plan 2. Similar to Plan 1,
the future Ward Road crossing with Leyden Creek would not be impacted by
this alternative.

#### 5.6.3 Reach 3 

**Plan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative**  
Plan 1 proposes to convey the 10-yr discharge under the Croke Canal via
two 8 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC’s. Any flows that exceeded the 10-yr discharge
would comingle with the decreed Croke Canal flow and overflow back into
Leyden Creek through a passive weir spillway. The spillway on the
downstream embankment diverts any flows in excess of the decreed flow
back into Leyden Creek. Formalization of the passive weir structure will
need to meet canal district approval.

At Indiana Street, a 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC is proposed to convey the
100-yr discharge below the roadway.

**Plan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative**  
To address flows with the potential to spill from Leyden Creek, west of
Cameo Estates, an overflow channel has been proposed to add overall
floodplain capacity. Low frequency flows would continue along the
existing Leyden Creek alignment while the overflow diversion channel
would convey flows with potential to cause flooding away from the
possible flooding areas.

At the Croke Canal crossing (3) 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC’s are proposed to
convey the entire 100-yr discharge under the Croke Canal. By conveying
the 100-yr discharge under the canal, the comingling of Leyden Creek and
the Croke Canal would be minimized, eliminating the need for the weir
spillway.

The 100-year crossing at Indiana Street proposed in Plan 1 is carried
forward to this alternative.

**Plan 3: Combination Alternate**  
Plan 3 proposes to convey the 100-yr discharge under the Croke Canal
with (3) 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC as proposed in Plan 2 in addition to the
passive weir spillway. By spilling any flows in excess of the 100-year
discharge at this location, the canal downstream is protected by
limiting the canal to the decreed flow. The diversion channel proposed
downstream of the Croke Canal in Plan 3 is increased in size to convey
events larger than the 100-year, such as the event in September 2013.
The channel was sized to accommodate the peak flow witnessed downstream
of Leyden Lake in September 2013, reported in the Water & Earth
Technologies report of 1,351 cfs. This flow is more than double the
100-yr design discharge of 665 cfs at this location.

Although 100-year flood hazards have not been identified for the Cameo
Estates No. 1 subdivision, the flooding in September 2013 impacted many
homes in this area. Overbank grading is proposed south of Cameo Estates
to add capacity to the current floodplain for flows in excess of the
100-year event.

#### 5.6.4 Reach 4

No alternatives were developed for the Leyden Creek crossing with the
Church Ditch. Following the breach of the canal in September 2013,
Ecological Resource Consultants, Inc. and SM&RC Structural Engineers
Inc. prepared construction drawings for a new crossing to be
constructed.

**Plan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative**  
To convey the 100-year design discharge under Quaker Street, five 10 ft.
x 8 ft. RCBC’s are proposed to convey the flow with no overtopping.
Upstream in Pattridge Open Space, check structures implemented
throughout this reach would stabilize the longitudinal channel slope
preventing any further channel degradation. At West 82^nd^ Avenue, a
five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC crossing is proposed to prevent
overtopping of the roadway.

At Blue Mountain Road, alternatives were developed to prevent
overtopping during the 100-yr design storm. Plan 1 proposes to
reconstruct and elevate Blue Mountain Road allowing two 8 ft. x 6 ft.
RCBC’s to be installed under Blue Mountain Road along the historic flow
path. One of the RCBC would replace the existing culvert with the other
structure located further southeast to collect flows that overtop the
Union Pacific Railroad embankment. A grouted boulder structure is
proposed to divert the overtopping railroad flows into the proposed
RCBC.

**Plan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative**  
This plan includes an alternative to detain the 100-year flows in Leyden
Lake without overtopping of the emergency spillway. This alternative
would require raising the spillway crest and dam embankment
approximately one foot. Although these improvements reduce the discharge
out of Leyden Lake from 665 cfs to 224 cfs, this alternative had no
impact on the sizes of roadway crossings downstream of Leyden Lake.
Basins tributary to the Indiana Street crossing produce a peak flow of
663 cfs, independent of any improvements made to Leyden Lake.

By implementing the crossing structure at Quaker Street from Plan 1 in
addition to increasing the channel capacity throughout Leyden Townsite,
the floodplain can be removed from structures not mitigated with Plan 1.

A five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC will convey the 100-year discharge under
West 82^nd^ Avenue. A new channel alignment is proposed removing the
existing trailhead from the floodplain.

At Blue Mountain Road, Plan 2 proposes to eliminate all overtopping of
the railroad embankment by installing a second 72” CMP pipe through the
railroad embankment. On the downstream side of the embankment two 8 ft.
x 6 ft. RCBC will convey the flow under Blue Mountain Road.

## 5.7 Qualitative Evaluation Procedure

A benefit cost analysis was completed for the Leyden Townsite, Indiana,
Alkire, and Woodland Valley No. 7 proposed project locations. FEMA’s
Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) Tool, version 5.0.0.0, was used to calculate
flood mitigation benefits for structures within the project areas.
Structure size and type were taken from the Jefferson County parcel
data. First floor elevations were estimated from the 1ft project
mapping. Additional assumptions used in the BCA calculations include:

- Mitigated 10-, 50-, and 100-year water surface elevation set to 2.2, 2.1, and 2.0 feet below first floor elevation respectively.

- Mitigated 500-year water surface elevation set to 0.5 feet lower than pre-mitigation elevation.

- Building replacement value (BRV) was set at \$117/sf for residential structures and reduced by 50%, or \$60/sf for barns and greenhouses.

- Project useful life set at 30 years for all projects, per culvert projects using BCA guidelines.

- Standard FEMA library damage curves were used for each structure.

- Based on a comparison of reported structure size and aerial footprint size, all structures were assumed to not have basements.

- All foundations were assumed to be slab on grade.

- Pre mitigation water surface elevations, channel elevations, and discharges taken from effective hydraulic models and interpolated for structures between cross sections as needed.

Present worth of damages were totaled for the structures impacted at
each proposed project to determine benefits of each project. The total
benefit was then divided by the project cost in order to estimate the
benefit cost ratio. The total benefit values can be seen in [Table 5-5](#).
The resulting benefit cost ratio for each proposed project is included
in [Table 5-6](#).

While none of the proposed projects yield a benefit-cost ratio close to
1.0, implementing these master plan alternatives reflect intangible
benefits associated with mitigating road overtopping, providing a
stabilized stream corridor, and providing maintenance access along the
drainageways.
