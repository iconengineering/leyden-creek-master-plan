The watershed is bounded to the north\nby the Little Dry Creek (ADCO) and Big Dry Creek (ADCO) watersheds and\nto the south by Ralston Creek. Leyden Creek, approximately 10.5 miles in\nlength, ranges in elevation from 5420 feet at the confluence with\nRalston Creek south of 72nd Avenue and Simms Street to 7648 feet at the\nupstream watershed limits. The extent of the project area is shown in\n\nFigure ES 2\n.\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake, the watershed primarily consists of\nresidential development. Although the majority of the basin upstream of\nLeyden Lake is undeveloped, new development is ongoing and includes both\nresidential and industrial areas. Undeveloped open space is also\nprevalent within the Arvada city limits and within unincorporated\nJefferson County.\n\n\nCurrent development includes two large planned residential developments,\nboth located upstream of Leyden Lake. The Leyden Rock development is\nlocated north of W 82\nnd\n Avenue at Quaker Street extending west to the\nJefferson County landfill. Leyden Ranch West is located directly to the\neast of Leyden Rock. Based on input from project sponsors these two\ndevelopments were assumed to be fully built out since they were under\nconstruction at the time of this study. Planned development for Leyden\nRanch East is also forthcoming; however since it is not currently under\nconstruction it was not considered built for the existing condition\nanalysis.\n\n\nAlthough there are several detention facilities in the watershed, only\nfour met criteria to be considered for flood reduction purposes in this\nstudy. Leyden Lake, providing the most capacity for storage, is located\nnear the center of the watershed. Upstream of Leyden Lake, a regional\npond exists and will be formalized in the location of an existing sump\ndownstream of the Leyden Ranch West development. The other two ponds\nincluded in the study are at Ralston Valley High School and at\nLamplighter Park.\n\n\nThere are three major canals that flow through the project area,\nincluding the Church Ditch, Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal, and Croke Canal.\nAll three of these canals convey irrigation water from Clear Creek north\nto their distribution locations. Leyden Creek crosses the Church Ditch\nupstream of Leyden Lake and downstream of Quaker Street. The Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal is located directly downstream of Leyden Lake. The Croke\nCanal is located downstream of Indiana Street and also upstream of the\nCameo Estates neighborhood. For the hydrologic analysis, canals were\nconsidered to be flowing full and not intercept immediate runoff;\nhowever means for stormwater to cross the canal systems were considered\nwith the alternatives analysis and conceptual design plan.\n\n\nFigure ES-1\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nFigure ES-2\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nTable ES-2: ES 100-yr Hydrology Reconciliation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nES.3.1 Project Area Hydrology\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA new hydrologic model was prepared for the entire Leyden Creek\nwatershed, updating the hydrology for the existing and future land use\nconditions, for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storm\nfrequencies. The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP v1.4.3), was\nused to develop runoff hydrographs for each individual sub-watershed.\nThe hydrographs from each subwatershed were then routed using the EPA\nStormwater Management Model (SWMM), version 5.0.022 to determine\ndischarges at each design point.\n\n\nUpdating projected land use led to increased flow rates upstream of\nLeyden Lake, and subsequently overtopping of the emergency spillway\nduring the 100-year event. However, downstream of the reservoir, due to\nvariations in watershed routing and total contributing area, the flow\nrates east of Alkire Street were reduced compared to previous studies.\n\n\nA comparison of design flow rates to previous studies can be found in\n\nTable ES 2\n.\n\n\nDuring the September 2013 flood event, flow entered the Leyden Creek\nwatershed at the upstream end of the basin near Blue Mountain Road.\nDetailed hydraulic analyses determined that flow contributions in this\narea were more of a result from erosion that occurred adjacent to the\nroadway versus the surface topography. Although this area was not\nincluded in the watershed hydrology, alternatives were prepared to\nmaintain flow heading to Coal Creek versus contributing to Leyden Creek\nin the future.\n\n\nES.3.2 Project Area Hydraulics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNew flood hazard delineations were not completed with this study.\nHydraulic analyses for Leyden Creek were assembled from past reports and\nstudies, and served as the basis of evaluating proposed improvements.\nUpstream of Leyden Lake, a HEC-RAS model, developed by ICON Engineering,\nas part of Colorado Water Conversation Board\u2019s, Clear Creek Watershed\nRisk Map Project was utilized. Downstream of Leyden Lake, hydraulic\nmodeling from the 2006 Mapleleaf Subdivision Filing No. 2 LOMR\n(06-08-B422P) and the 2005 LOMR model based on the 2004 Boyle FHAD study\nwere used for the hydraulic evaluations.\n\n\nPast models were updated with the future development conditions,\n100-year flow rates for comparison between proposed alternatives and\nexisting conditions. All roadway crossings except Simms Street were\ndetermined to be inadequate to convey the 100-year discharges.\n\n\nES.4 Alternative Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFollowing the identification of problem areas, alternatives were\ndeveloped to mitigate flooding potential and implement the project goals\nset forth by project sponsors and local stakeholders.\n\n\nThree main alternative categories were developed to address the problems\nidentified: Channel Conveyance, Channel Stability, and Crossing\nImprovements. Channel Conveyance alternatives mitigate flooding by\nadding conveyance capacity to the existing channel and removing\nstructures from the floodplain where possible. Channel Stability\nalternatives were developed to prevent future erosion within the\nwatershed by stabilizing the channel slope. Crossing improvement\nalternatives improved roadway crossing structures to meet local\njurisdictional criteria.\n\n\nLeyden Lake was evaluated to restore the facility to contain the\n100-year event. The addition of alternate regional detention facilities,\nbeyond Leyden Lake, were not considered.\n\n\nAlternatives at the Croke Canal were designed to address the interaction\nbetween Leyden Creek and the canal. During the September 2013 flood\nevent, the canal was breached at the Leyden Creek crossing to alleviate\nthe overtopping and eroding canal banks near West 78\nth\n Place and\nEldridge Street which flooded homes in the Cameo Estates subdivision. No\nalternatives were developed for the Church Ditch as construction plans\nfor improvements had been prepared by others outside of this project.\n\n\nThe recommended plan selected alternatives effective in meeting\njurisdictional criteria and reducing affects from flooding. In areas\nwhere structures were impacted by the floodplain, benefit versus cost\nratios were calculated for comparison purposes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure ES : Watershed Map\n\n\nTable ES : ES 100-yr Hydrology Reconciliation\n\n\nES.5 Master Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe project sponsors selected all alternatives included in the\nrecommended plan with one modification. The 100-yr Conveyance\nalternative was selected for Reach 1 rather than the Minimum Crossing\nImprovement and Maintenance Alternative. The Selected Plan letter can be\nfound in \nAPPENDIX A - Project Correspondence\n\n\nES.5.1 Reach 1 Confluence with Ralston Creek to Leyden Creek Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe selected plan for Reach 1 includes improving the bridge at West\n72\nnd\n Avenue and increasing the capacity of the channel downstream of\nWest 72\nnd\n Avenue. Boulder walls are proposed along the downstream\nchannel to minimize the encroachment onto private properties. A 10 foot\nconcrete pedestrian trail was also included from Simms Street, through\nWest 72\nnd\n Avenue, connecting to the existing trail on the west side of\nLeyden Creek to Leyden Creek Park. This project will remove the First\nChurch of Arvada from the floodplain.\n\n\nUpstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, in the Woodland Valley No. 7\nsubdivision, the capacity of the channel is increased to mitigate the\n100-year floodplain on adjacent structures currently shown within the\nregulatory FEMA floodplain. Approximately 530 feet of the existing\npedestrian path will also be relocated with the proposed channel\nproject. This project will remove the eight residential homes that are\ncurrently in the 100-year floodplain.\n\n\nES.5.2 Reach 2 Leyden Creek Park to Upstream of Alkire Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn extension of Ward Road from West 72\nnd\n Avenue north to the existing\nalignment was in development at the time of this master plan. 30%\nconceptual design plans were provided by the City of Arvada for\nincorporation into this report. The roadway expansion will include a\nstream crossing downstream of West 75\nth\n Place as well as two\npedestrian trail underpasses.\n\n\nIn order to meet current Jefferson County criteria, the roadway crossing\nat West 75\nth\n Place was designed to convey the 10-year discharge with\n1-foot of overtopping for the 100-year event. Twin 9 ft. x 4 ft.\nReinforced Concrete Box Culverts (RCBC) are proposed at this location.\nConcrete encasement of the existing sanitary sewer will be required due\nto the limitation of cover between the bottom of the culvert and the\nsanitary sewer. This project will not remove the residential home\ndownstream of West 75\nth\n Place from the floodplain.\n\n\nTo mitigate the roadway overtopping and shallow flooding that impacts\nproperty to the east of Alkire Street, new box culverts have been\nproposed. Four 12 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are required to convey the 100-year\ndischarge without overtopping the low point in Alkire Street. Headwater\ndepth at this location is limited by the sanitary crossing located east\nof the stream crossing. This project will require that the existing pond\nfeatures, upstream of Alkire Street, be adjusted and lowered\naccordingly. A 4 foot sloping drop structure is proposed to tie back\ninto existing grades along the channel. Eleven structures, including six\nresidential homes would be removed from the shallow flooding hazard area\neast of Alkire with the implementation of this project.\n\n\nSeveral check structures proposed within Reach 2 will stabilize the\nchannel slope preventing future channel degradation.\n\n\nES.5.3 Reach 3 Upstream of Alkire Street to Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDuring the September 2013 event, spill flows from Leyden Creek diverted\neast, flooding areas within the Cameo Estates subdivision. Although the\nflood flows generally exceed that of the 100-year level, to help\nmitigate these hazards, re-grading of the pond bank east of Cameo\nEstates will help keep flows within Leyden Creek and prevent flows from\nspilling back into the Cameo Estates subdivision.\n\n\nAt the Croke Canal a triple cell 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC will convey the\n100-year flow underneath the canal eliminating the need for the existing\nsiphon. The downstream bank of the canal will also be reinforced, with a\ndefined spillway to protect the canal in the event that overtopping\noccurs in the future. Feasibility of including a purge structure to\nreduce flows in the canal at this location should be investigated in the\nfuture between representatives from the Croke Canal and City of Arvada;\nhowever this purge structure has not been included in this plan, at this\ntime.\n\n\nSimilarly, at Indiana Street a 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC is proposed to convey\nthe 100-year discharge below the roadway. Improving the roadway crossing\nstructure at Indiana Street will remove the two homes south of the\nLeyden Creek crossing from the floodplain.\n\n\nES.5.4 Reach 4 Upstream of Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo incorporate the future pedestrian trail, a 180 ft. span bridge is\nproposed at Quaker Street. A 10 foot concrete pedestrian trail with 10\nfeet of clearance will provide access to the south along Quaker Street\nfor future trailhead and pedestrian bridge east of Quaker Street. To\navoid disturbance to adjacent residential homes north of Leyden Creek,\nthe channel alignment is proposed to be realigned further south and will\nrequire property acquisition. A large water line and high pressure gas\nline will require relocation. This plan follows the current alignment of\nQuaker Street. Future changes to Quaker Street in this area should be\nconsidered with final design of the improvements. The two residential\nstructures north of the Leyden Creek crossing at Quaker Street would be\nremoved with the implementation of this project.\n\n\nThroughout Pattridge Open Space, check structures have been proposed to\nstabilize the channel slope and prevent future degradation and erosion.\n\n\nAt West 82\nnd\n Avenue a five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC crossing structure\nhas been proposed to convey the 100-year discharge below the roadway.\n\n\nUpstream, at Blue Mountain Road, the existing crossing structure is\nproposed to be replaced with two 8 ft. x 6 ft. RCBCs. Approximately 1300\nfeet of Blue Mountain Road is proposed to also be reconstructed to gain\nadequate roadway cover over the proposed culverts and to prevent\novertopping back into the Leyden Creek Watershed.\n\n\nTable ES : Master Plan\nReach by Reach Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nTable ES : Master Plan\nJurisdictional Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nFigure ES : Master Plan\nSchematic\n\n\nReferences\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtkins, Technical Drainage Memorandum Ward Road, January 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyle Engineering Corporation, Ralston/Leyden Creeks Hydrology\n    Report, 2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyle Engineering Corporation, Ralston/Leyden Creek Flood Hazard\n    Area Delineation, 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity of Arvada, Arvada Comprehensive Plan, October 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity of Arvada, Engineering Code of Standards and Specifications,\n    July 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Resources Consultants, Inc. and SM&RC Structural\n    Engineers Inc., Church Ditch Water Authority 82\nnd\n Avenue & Quaker\n    Street Jefferson County, Colorado Leyden Crossing Construction\n    Drawings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICON Engineering Inc., Clear Creek Watershed Flood Study Mapping\n    Barbara Gulch and Leyden Creek Hydraulics Report, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJefferson County, Design & Technical Criteria Storm Drainage,\n    Revised November 2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service,\n    \nSoil Survey of Golden Area, Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n    Drainage and Flood Control District, \nColorado Urban Hydrograph\n    Procedure 2005  version 1.4.3\n, January 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURS Greiner Woodward Clyde, Flood Control Improvements for Leyden\n    Lake Dam, 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Army Corps of Engineers, \nHEC-RAS River Analysis\n    System User\u2019s Manual Version 4.1,\n Revised January 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA SWMM version 5.0 Storm\n    Water Management Model User\u2019s Manual Version 5.0, Revised July 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban Drainage & Flood Control District et al, \nUrban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual\n, 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVision Land Consultants, Inc., Request for Letter of Map Revision\n    Mapleleaf subdivision Filing No. 2, 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater & Earth Technologies, September 11-13, 2013 Arvada Flood Event\n    Reconstruction and Documentation, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWright  McLaughlin Engineers, Ralston/Leyden Creek Major\n    Drainageway Planning, 1977\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWright Water Engineers, Lower Ralston/Van Bibber and Leyden Creeks\n    Phase B Report, February 1986\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A - Project\nCorrespondence\n\n\nAPPENDIX B  Hydrologic\nAnalysis\n\n\nAPPENDIX C  Hydraulic\nAnalysis\n\n\nAPPENDIX D  Legal Opinion\n\n\nAPPENDIX E  Wetland and\nRiparian Inventory\n\n\nAPPENDIX F  Alternative\nAnalysis\n\n\nAPPENDIX G  Conceptual\nDesign Information\n\n\nAPPENDIX H  Master Plan Maps\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MASTER PLAN MAP\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW PRESET 11X17 MAPS\n\n\nAPPENDIX I  Master Plan\nProfiles\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MASTER PLAN PROFILE\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW PRESET 11X17 PROFILES",

The roadway expansion will include a\nstream crossing downstream of West 75 th  Place as well as two\npedestrian trail underpasses.  In order to meet current Jefferson County criteria, the roadway crossing\nat West 75 th  Place was designed to convey the 10-year discharge with\n1-foot of overtopping for the 100-year event. Twin 9 ft. x 4 ft.\nReinforced Concrete Box Culverts (RCBC) are proposed at this location.\nConcrete encasement of the existing sanitary sewer will be required due\nto the limitation of cover between the bottom of the culvert and the\nsanitary sewer. This project will not remove the residential home\ndownstream of West 75 th  Place from the floodplain.  To mitigate the roadway overtopping and shallow flooding that impacts\nproperty to the east of Alkire Street, new box culverts have been\nproposed. Four 12 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are required to convey the 100-year\ndischarge without overtopping the low point in Alkire Street. Headwater\ndepth at this location is limited by the sanitary crossing located east\nof the stream crossing. This project will require that the existing pond\nfeatures, upstream of Alkire Street, be adjusted and lowered\naccordingly. A 4 foot sloping drop structure is proposed to tie back\ninto existing grades along the channel. Eleven structures, including six\nresidential homes would be removed from the shallow flooding hazard area\neast of Alkire with the implementation of this project.  Several check structures proposed within Reach 2 will stabilize the\nchannel slope preventing future channel degradation.",

Although the\nflood flows generally exceed that of the 100-year level, to help\nmitigate these hazards, re-grading of the pond bank east of Cameo\nEstates will help keep flows within Leyden Creek and prevent flows from\nspilling back into the Cameo Estates subdivision.  At the Croke Canal a triple cell 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC will convey the\n100-year flow underneath the canal eliminating the need for the existing\nsiphon. The downstream bank of the canal will also be reinforced, with a\ndefined spillway to protect the canal in the event that overtopping\noccurs in the future. Feasibility of including a purge structure to\nreduce flows in the canal at this location should be investigated in the\nfuture between representatives from the Croke Canal and City of Arvada;\nhowever this purge structure has not been included in this plan, at this\ntime.

            "text": "Study Area Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\n2.1 Project Area\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Leyden Creek watershed has a drainage area of approximately 11.8 square\nmiles, located in the City of Arvada and unincorporated Jefferson\nCounty. The watershed is bounded to the north by the Little Dry Creek\n(ADCO) and Big Dry Creek (ADCO) watersheds and to the south by Ralston\nCreek. Leyden Creek, approximately 10.5 miles in length, ranges in\nelevation from 5420 feet at the confluence with Ralston Creek south of\n72\nnd\n Avenue and Simms Street to 7648 feet at the upstream watershed\nlimits. The watershed has an average slope of approximately 2.9%. The\nUDFCD Reuse number for the Leyden Creek watershed is 4308. The extents\nof the project area can be seen in \nFigure 2\u20112\n.\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake, the watershed primarily consists of\nresidential development. Although the majority of the basin upstream of\nLeyden Lake is undeveloped, new development is ongoing and includes both\nresidential and industrial areas. Undeveloped open space is also\nprevalent within the Arvada city limits and within Jefferson County.\n\n\nCurrent development includes two large planned residential developments,\nboth located upstream of Leyden Lake. The Leyden Rock development is\nlocated north of W 82\nnd\n Avenue at Quaker Street extending west to the\nJefferson County landfill. Leyden Ranch West is located directly to the\neast of Leyden Rock. Based on input from project sponsors these two\ndevelopments were assumed to be fully built out since they were under\nconstruction at the time of this study. Planned development Leyden Ranch\nEast is also forthcoming; however since it is not currently under\nconstruction it was not considered built for the existing condition\nanalysis.\n\n\nThe majority of the watershed is comprised of Type C soil as defined by\nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Type A, Type B, Type\nD soil are also present within the watershed. A soil map of the\nwatershed can be found in \nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Hydrologic Analysis.\n\n\nAlthough there are several detention facilities in the watershed, only\nfour met criteria to be considered for flood reduction purposes in this\nstudy. Leyden Lake, providing the most storage of these facilities, is\nlocated near the center of the watershed. Upstream of Leyden Lake, a\nregional pond exists and will be formalized in the location of an\nexisting sump downstream of the Leyden Ranch West development. The other\ntwo ponds included in the study are at Ralston Valley High School and at\nLamplighter Park.\n\n\nThere are three major canals that flow through the project area,\nincluding the Church Ditch, Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal, and Croke Canal.\nAll three of these canals convey irrigation water from Clear Creek north\nto their distribution locations. Leyden Creek crosses the Church Ditch\nupstream of Leyden Lake and downstream of Quaker Street. The Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal is located directly downstream of Leyden Lake. The Croke\nCanal is located downstream of Indiana Street and also upstream of the\nCameo Estates neighborhood. Canals were considered to be flowing full at\nthe time of the storm for the hydrologic analysis.\n\n\nDemo Map\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Land Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLand use was determined by zoning data provided by project sponsors in\nGIS format and the City of Arvada\u2019s Comprehensive Land Use Plan. As\ndirected by project sponsors, the Land Use Plan was prioritized over the\nzoning information in conflicting areas.\n\n\nTo determine existing conditions, aerial imagery was used to compare to\nzoning data. When zoning data did not correlate with existing\nstructures, the zoning shapefiles were divided to better represent\nexisting conditions. This was more prevalent in Jefferson County where\nexisting development overlapped with agricultural zones. Table RO-3 of\nthe Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM) was used to select\nimpervious values for each land use type. For residential development,\nFigures RO-3, RO-4, RO-5 (USDCM) were utilized to determine impervious\npercentages.\n\n\nThe Jefferson County landfill located east of Hwy 93 and north of W.\n82\nnd\n Avenue was assigned an impervious value of 15 %. This value was\nselected after project sponsor agreement based on soil conditions\nconsistent with landfill cover and operations. This value also maintains\nconsistency with hydrology submitted for ongoing FEMA update studies.\nThe Pioneer Sand Company, located south of W. 82\nnd\n Avenue, was assumed\nto have an open space impervious value. The existing conditions land use\nmap can be found in \nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nFor the future land use conditions, impervious values anticipate future\ndevelopment based on land use and zoning information collected from\nproject sponsors. Consideration was given to current land-use, where it\nexceeded future projections based on zoning. In general, the future\nconditions percent impervious values exceed those developed for previous\nstudies. Downstream of Leyden Lake the watershed is primarily developed,\nresulting in similar land use for both existing and future conditions.\nUpstream of the reservoir higher impervious values resulted from the\nplanned development areas and industrial locations.\n\n\nThrough discussions with project sponsors,\nthe area west of Highway 93, and south of Highway 72, zoned commercial\nand industrial in Arvada, was replaced with open space based on the land\nuse plan. The future conditions land use map can be found in \nAPPENDIX B\n\u2013 Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\n2.3 Reach Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor the purposes of this study Leyden Creek was divided into four\nreaches. Descriptions of each reach are provided below and can be seen\non maps provided in \nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Hydrologic Analysis\n\n\nClickable Map\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake a detailed floodplain analysis was conducted\nin the 2004 Boyle Flood Hazard Area Delineation study. Upstream of\nLeyden Lake an approximate detail (Zone A) floodplain exists for Leyden\nCreek and a small portion of Barbara Gulch near the confluence with\nLeyden Creek.\n\n\nTable \u2011: Land Use Description\n\n\nReach 1- Confluence with Ralston Creek to Leyden Creek Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nThroughout Reach 1, Leyden Creek is bordered by residential land uses.\nThis reach of Leyden Creek is approximately 0.7 miles long and primarily\nconsists of a grass lined channel. Leyden Creek crosses Simms St. and W\n72\nnd\n Ave in this reach, passing through the Mapleleaf and Woodland\nValley subdivisions.\n\n\nReach 2- Leyden Creek Park to Upstream of Alkire Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReach 2 stretches approximately 1 mile through residential development\nof large acre lots. The stream meanders through this reach crossing\nAlkire St. at the upstream end of the reach also crossing W 75\nth\n Pl.\nthroughout the reach. The majority of this reach is contained in the\nCameo Estates Unit 2 subdivision.\n\n\nReach 3 \u2013 Upstream of Alkire St to Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nReach 3, approximately 1.1 miles, contains the Indiana St. and Croke\nCanal crossings. Downstream of the crossings, the neighborhood of Cameo\nEstates lies to the north with Youth Memorial Park to the south.\n\n\nReach 4 \u2013 Upstream of Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReach 4 consist primarily of a natural\nchannel on undeveloped land. The creek meanders approximately 3.3 miles\nduring this reach, starting at Highway 93 crossing W 82\nnd\n Avenue and\nQuaker St. prior to entering Leyden Lake, downstream. The Leyden Rock\nand Leyden Ranch West residential developments are currently under\nconstruction north of W. 82\nnd\n Avenue. These developments will\ncontribute flows upstream of the Leyden Creek crossing with Quaker St.\nin the Leyden Townsite subdivision.\n\n\n2.4 Flood History\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is limited information on any flooding along Leyden Creek prior to\nthe September 2013 flood event. Past hydrology studies noted severe\nflooding may have been likely, only went unrecorded. The 2009 UDFCD\nRalston Creek Flood Warning Plan also did not identify past flooding\nevents on Leyden Creek\n\n\nThere are two UDFCD stream gages located within the Leyden Creek\nwatershed. Stream Gage 203 - Leyden Reservoir Water PT was installed in\nDecember 2002 located in Leyden Lake. The maximum discharge of 1,351 cfs\nfrom this gage was recorded on September 12, 2013. Stream Gage 213 \u2013\nLeyden Confluence was installed May 1988 located east of Simms St near\nthe confluence with Ralston Creek. The record high water for this\nlocation occurred August 6, 1995 with a peak flow of 3,520 cfs. In their\n2014 report on the flooding events of Leyden Creek, Water and Earth\nTechnologies Inc. (WET) suggested Stream Gage 213 is recalibrated due to\nwhat they believed to be an overestimation of flows compared to their\nanalysis of high water marks.\n\n\nWET also reported the following regarding the September 2013 flood:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Blue Mountain Road, a plugged culvert beneath Blue Mountain Road\n    caused flows normally contributing to Coal Creek watershed to enter\n    the Leyden Creek basin. A peak flow of 280 cfs was estimated to pass\n    through the railroad embankment, eroding Blue Mountain Road where\n    the culvert was plugged. The erosion was repaired using 2,000 tons\n    of fill material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeyden Road (W. 82\nnd\n Ave) was overtopped by as much as three feet\n    at the Leyden Creek crossing. During the event the road was closed\n    between Indiana St. to Highway 93.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaker Street was overtopped with erosion bursting a 12\u201d water main.\n    The water supply was reconfigured and there was not a sustained\n    interruption of drinking water. Peak discharges from high water\n    marks were estimated to be between the 10-yr and 50-yr levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Church Ditch embankment breached at the crossing with Leyden\n    Creek, diverting flows to Leyden Lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outflow at Leyden Lake was recorded at 1,351 cfs much higher\n    than the previously estimated 100-yr release rate of 373 cfs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Street was overtopped prior to receiving spillway flows. The\n    roadway was ultimately inundated by up to a foot in depth.\n    Improvements were made from the existing 36- and 18-inch pipes to\n    triple (3) 36-inch CMPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Croke Canal intercepted flow from Leyden Creek when Leyden\n    overtopped the upstream canal embankment. Overtopping occurred at\n    Eldridge St. and W. 78\nth\n Place near Cameo Estates. An intentional\n    breach was made at the Leyden Creek crossing to prevent\n    breaches elsewhere. Breaching the canal resulted in a second, lower\n    flood peak on Leyden Creek impacting areas previously flooded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameo Estates is located between Eldrige St. and Alkire St. Several\n    residences were damaged, along with flooding in pastures, yards,\n    and streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkire St was overtopped from W. 78\nth\n Avenue to W. 74\nth\n Drive\n    and was closed for safety reasons during the storm. There was\n    significant flood inundation within the Youth Memorial Park/Sports\n    Complex, and likely reduced downstream discharges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the flow was much higher than the expected 100-yr release rates\nat Leyden Lake, several of the reaches downstream of the lake did not\nexperience flows on that same order of magnitude. The bridge on W.\n72\nnd\n Ave was not overtopped during the flood as was the bridge at\nSimms St. These structures were originally sized for a 100-yr event.",

The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP v1.4.3), was\nused to develop runoff hydrographs for each individual sub-watershed.\nThe hydrographs from each subwatershed were then routed using the EPA\nStormwater Management Model (SWMM), version 5.0.022 to determine\ndischarges at each design point.\n\n\nThe Leyden Creek watershed was divided into a total of 44 subwatersheds\nencompassing 11.78 square miles. After correspondence with UDFCD it was\ndetermined that the flow design points would be prioritized over\nsubwatershed size with sub-watersheds staying within the 3,000 acre\nlimits of CUHP.\n\n\nHydrologic routing generally followed the connectivity diagram presented\nin the 2003 Hydrology Report by Boyle Engineering; however the basin\nupstream of Leyden Lake was subdivided into 20 smaller basins, averaging\n294 acres in sizes; whereas the Boyle study only included two\nsub-watersheds for the same area.\n\n\nThe Blue Mountain Estates area contributed flow to the Leyden Creek\nwatershed during the September 2013 event. This area was analyzed to\ndetermine whether to include it in the watershed for this study. Through\na 2-dimentional analysis in FLO-2D, it was determined that the\ncontributing flow was more of a result from erosion during the storm\nthan surface topography. Therefore, the area was not included in the\nLeyden Creek watershed hydrology.\n\n\nFrom field review, two sub-watersheds (L303, L321) in the 2003 Boyle\nstudy were found to be non-tributary to Leyden Creek. Therefore, the\ntotal watershed area of the current study is slightly less than that\nused for past work (11.78 square miles versus 11.89 square miles).\n\n\n3.2 Design Rainfall\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne-hour rainfall depths were derived from the USDCM Figures RA-3\nthrough RA-12 for the project area and compared with those used for past\nstudies. Generally there were minimal differences, and the past rainfall\ndepths were carried forward. 2-, 5-, and 25-year rainfall depths, not\nprovided in the previous studies, were determined from Figures RA-1,\nRA-2, and RA-4 (USDCM). Areal adjustments were not applied since only a\nminor portion of the watershed exceeded the 10 square mile threshold\nneeded for adjustment. A summary of one-hour rainfall depths can be\nfound below in \nTable 3-1\n.\n\n\nComplete rainfall distributions are provided in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic\nAnalysis\n\n\nTable -: 1-hr Rainfall Depths\n\n\n3.3 Subwatershed Characteristics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSubwatershed characteristics are summarized in the CUHP input table and\nsubwatershed figure located in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n\n\n3.3.1 Subwatershed Delineation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, subwatersheds delineation focused on\nidentifying flow change locations for Leyden Creek. All basins conform\nto a maximum of 3,000 acres in size, with smaller subwatersheds located\nin more urban areas. The previous 2003 Boyle study included only 21\nsubwatersheds ranging in size from 44 acres to 3187 acres. This study\nincludes 44 subwatersheds averaging 171 acres, and ranging between 16\nacres to 1413 acres in size. Downstream of Leyden Lake the average\nwatershed size is only 69.1 acres. The Church Ditch, Farmers\u2019 High line\nCanal and Croke Canal were assumed full for the subwatershed\ndelineation.\n\n\n3.3.2 Watershed Imperviousness\n\uf0c1\n\n\nImperviousness for each subwatershed was estimated from a GIS based\ninterpretation of land use and zoning information described in Section\n\n2.2 Land Use\n.\n\n\n3.3.3 Length, Centroid Distance, Slope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCUHP parameters such as subwatershed length, distance to centroid, and\nslopes were derived for each subwatershed using topographic data. Slopes\nwere computed using the length-weighted, corrected average slope from\nEquation RO-9 and Figure RO-10 (USDCM). Subwatersheds downstream of\nLeyden Lake average a slope of 2.59% while the average for the entire\nwatershed is a 2.94% slope.\n\n\n3.3.4 Depression Losses\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDepression storage loss was determined based on Table RO-6 from the\nUSDCM. Aerial imagery was used to examine each subwatershed. Generally\nthe depression loss value of 0.35 for pervious areas and 0.1 for\nimpervious areas was carried forward from previous studies. A pervious\ndepression storage value of 0.4 was used upstream of Leyden Lake in open\nspace areas.\n\n\n3.3.5 Infiltration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSoil data was obtained from Natural Resources Conservation Service\n(NRCS). The majority of the basin contains Type C soil consistent with\nthe 2003 Boyle Hydrology Report. Table RO-7 provided Horton\u2019s\ninfiltration parameters for Type C/D soil which consists of an initial\ninfiltration rate of 3.0 inches per hour, a final infiltration rate of\n0.5 inches per hour and a decay coefficient of 0.0018. There are several\nbasins upstream of Leyden Lake that were found to contain Type B soil\nand parameters for these basins were adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n3.4 Hydrograph Routing\n\uf0c1\n\n\n3.4.1 Manning\u2019s n coefficient\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach hydraulic Manning\u2019s n roughness coefficient value was selected\nusing Table MD-1 from USDCM. Following UDFCD guidance the values were\nthen increased by 25% to better represent modeling conditions.\n\n\n3.4.2 Conveyance Elements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach conveyance element was determined by examining the contour data and\ncomparing to previous studies. Storm sewers sizes and alignments were\nmodeled based on the City of Arvada GIS files. A SWMM routing map and a\nSWMM schematic figure are included in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic\nAnalysis\n.\n\n\n3.4.3 Detention Facilities\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetention facilities within the watershed were evaluated and those\nmeeting size and public ownership requirements were included in the SWMM\nrouting. The inclusion of detention areas was reviewed with project\nsponsors. Detention was modeled at Leyden Lake, the Leyden Ranch sump,\nLamplighter Park, and at Ralston Valley High School. Storage volumes for\neach facility were determined from the project topographic mapping.\nRelease rates were developed from orifice and weir calculations\nreflecting the existing outlet structure configurations. Storage and\ndischarge curves for the four detention facilities are provided in\n\nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n\n\nLeyden Lake was examined in further detail due to past discrepancies in\nthe spillway elevation. The City of Arvada conducted a survey to\ndetermine the elevation of the spillway in relation to the Leyden Creek\nDam As-Built drawings and project mapping. A conversion value of +2.2\nfeet was provided by Arvada to convert from the City of Arvada datum to\nthe project datum, NAVD 88. As-built elevations from the dam were\nadjusted to the project datum by adding 2.9 feet. Datum conversion\ninformation is included in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\n3.5 Previous Studies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn 1977 Wright-McLaughlin Engineers utilized the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology Catchment program (MITCAT) to develop a model for\nRalston/Leyden Creeks. The results of this MITCAT model were used to\ndevelop the effective FEMA flood insurance study (FIS).\n\n\nIn 2003 Boyle Engineering Corporation updated the hydrology for Ralston\nCreek and Leyden Lake. The purpose of the Boyle study was to update the\nwatershed model from MITCAT to CUHP/UDSWMM. The model reflected\nimprovements made to Leyden Creek Dam. Boyle examined the 10-, 50-,\n100-, and 500-year events. A FHAD downstream of Leyden Lake was also\nprepared which utilized the updated flow results.\n\n\n3.6 Hydrograph Calibration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWith input from the project sponsors, three basins (106, 115, 303)\nrequired calibration. Due to the topography of the project area, these\nbasins were underestimating runoff due to excessive length to width\nratios. The peak runoff rate coefficient, Cp, was increased for each\nbasin to produce runoff comparable to basins with similar impervious\ncharacteristics. Increases in peak flows, especially upstream of Leyden\nLake, can be attributed to the increases in imperviousness within the\nwatershed and variations in sub-watershed routing.\n\n\n3.7 Results of Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe results of the analysis are presented in \nTable 3-2\n. As noted\nabove, results compare well with past studies prepared for the UDFCD and\nadopted by FEMA. Increased discharges can be correlated with increases\nin watershed imperviousness and variations in sub-watershed routing.\n\n\nIt should also be noted that past hydrology for Leyden and Ralston\nCreeks performed rainfall adjustments for watershed areas in excess of\n10 square miles. These adjustments have not been performed with the\ncurrent update since at 11.8 square miles, the watershed is only\nmoderately above the 10 square mile threshold for rainfall adjustment.\nAdditionally, peak flows along Leyden Creek were already lower than the\neffective flows. If a similar adjustment was made, peak discharges east\nof Alkire Street would be reduced further.\n\n\nThe increase in flows from the previous study from below Leyden Lake Dam\nto Alkire Street is due to the increase in discharge from Leyden Lake.\nThe discharge increased from 373 cfs from the 2003 Boyle Hydrology\nReport to 550 cfs with the updated information. The updated survey\ninformation combined with updates to land use projections lead to an\nincrease of flows into and out of Leyden Lake.\n\n\nThe decreased flows in lower reaches are caused by updated land use and\nadded detention facilities. The update in land use data lead to a lower\nimpervious value within Reach 3. Ralston Valley High School and\nLamplighter Park detention were included with this study reducing flows\nin basins that had higher impervious values.\n\n\nPeak flow and runoff volume tables are included for both existing and\nfuture conditions for all design points, and all frequencies in\n\nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n. Hydrographs and peak flow profiles\nare also provided in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis.\n\n\nTable -: Previous Studies Reconciliation (100 yr. Flows)\n\n\nTable -: Summary of Peak Flows",

The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP v1.4.3), was\nused to develop runoff hydrographs for each individual sub-watershed.\nThe hydrographs from each subwatershed were then routed using the EPA\nStormwater Management Model (SWMM), version 5.0.022 to determine\ndischarges at each design point.  The Leyden Creek watershed was divided into a total of 44 subwatersheds\nencompassing 11.78 square miles. After correspondence with UDFCD it was\ndetermined that the flow design points would be prioritized over\nsubwatershed size with sub-watersheds staying within the 3,000 acre\nlimits of CUHP.  Hydrologic routing generally followed the connectivity diagram presented\nin the 2003 Hydrology Report by Boyle Engineering; however the basin\nupstream of Leyden Lake was subdivided into 20 smaller basins, averaging\n294 acres in sizes; whereas the Boyle study only included two\nsub-watersheds for the same area.  The Blue Mountain Estates area contributed flow to the Leyden Creek\nwatershed during the September 2013 event. This area was analyzed to\ndetermine whether to include it in the watershed for this study. Through\na 2-dimentional analysis in FLO-2D, it was determined that the\ncontributing flow was more of a result from erosion during the storm\nthan surface topography. Therefore, the area was not included in the\nLeyden Creek watershed hydrology.  From field review, two sub-watersheds (L303, L321) in the 2003 Boyle\nstudy were found to be non-tributary to Leyden Creek. Therefore, the\ntotal watershed area of the current study is slightly less than that\nused for past work (11.78 square miles versus 11.89 square miles).",

Downstream of Leyden Lake, hydraulic\nmodeling from the 2006 Mapleleaf Subdivision Filing No. 2 LOMR\n(06-08-B422P) and the 2005 LOMR model based on the 2004 Boyle FHAD study\nwere used for the hydraulic evaluations..

A summary of these flood hazards is presented in\nthe Drainage Problem Areas Figure (Figure C-1) in \nAPPENDIX C \u2013\nHydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\n4.2.1 Flood Hazards of Reach 1\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of the confluence with Ralston Creek, to Simms Street, no\nbuildings are located within the 100-year floodplain boundary. The four\ncell, 12 feet by 5 feet reinforced concrete box culvert (RCBC) at Simms\nStreet conveys the 100-year discharges without overtopping.\n\n\nProblem Area 1A \u2013 Woodland Valley Filing No. 3\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDue to the overtopping of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, the 100-year floodplain is\nwidespread through the Woodland Valley Filing No. 3 subdivision.\nAlthough the residential homes are generally not inundated according to\nthe FEMA Flood Insurance Study, split flows from West 72\nnd\n Avenue\nsurround many of the buildings. The First United Church of Arvada is the\nonly building inundated from this flooding. Flood problems in this area\nrelate to adding capacity at West 72\nnd\n Avenue without worsening\nflooding potential within the Woodland Valley subdivision, as well as\nimproving flood conditions for First United Church.\n\n\nProblem Area 1B \u2013 West 72\nnd\n Avenue Bridge Crossing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe bridge roadway crossing at West 72\nnd\n Avenue has a conveyance\ncapacity less than the 10-year event. Flows in excess of the bridge\ncapacity divert water east flowing across West 72\nnd\n Avenue as\ndescribed in Problem Area 1A. The City of Arvada would like to maintain\n100-year capacity at all major crossings.\n\n\nProblem Area 1C \u2013 Woodland Valley Filing No. 7\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, eight residential homes are impacted by\nthe 100-year floodplain due to a lack of channel conveyance capacity\ndownstream of Leyden Creek Park.\n\n\n4.2.2 Flood Hazards of Reach 2\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWithin Reach 2, one residential home and two additional buildings are\nimpacted by the 100-year regulatory floodplain.\n\n\nProblem Area 2A \u2013 West 75\nth\n Place\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne residential home is located within the 100-year floodplain boundary\nwithin Reach 2. The structure is located shortly downstream of West\n75\nth\n Place. The road crossing at West 75\nth\n Place is undersized 36\u201d\nCMP, with a conveyance capacity less than the 2-year discharge.\n\n\nProblem Area 2B \u2013 Cameo Estates Unit No. 2\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of West 75\nth\n Place, Problem Area 2C and 2D lead to the Zone X\nShaded shallow flooding seen in Cameo Estates Unit No. 2. The shallow\nflooding flows spilling over Alkire impact several residential\nbuildings, although these structures are not within the regulatory\n100-year floodplain boundary. There are two structures within the\nregulatory floodplain between Alkire Street and West 75\nth\n Place.\n\n\nProblem Area 2C \u2013 Alkire Street Culvert Crossing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlkire Street is overtopped for the 2-year and larger discharges. As\nshown by past studies, and as part of the 2013 flood, the low point in\nAlkire Street does not occur at the culvert location, but approximately\n600 feet south of the culvert. Flooding from the low point in this area\nresults in widespread shallow flows across Alkire Street to the east,\nwithin the Cameo Estates Unit No. 2 subdivision. The City of Arvada\nwishes to manage a higher level of capacity for the crossing at this\nlocation to reduce flooding potential downstream.\n\n\nProblem Area 2D \u2013 Upstream of Alkire Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of Alkire Street, Leyden Creek spills out of its right bank\nacross the Youth Memorial Sports Complex entrance road diverting flows\nsouth spilling over Alkire Street. Any flows that are diverted as part\nof Problem Area 2D contribute to the flood hazards mentioned in Problem\nArea 2C.\n\n\n4.2.3 Flood Hazards of Reach 3\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProblem areas within this reach relate to the impacts of private ponds\nin the floodplain areas in addition to the buildings and residences\nlocated within the floodplain. A total of three structures, two\nresidential homes are inundated by the 100-year floodplain within Reach\n3.\n\n\nProblem Area 3A \u2013 Cameo Estates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlthough not impacted by the 100-year regulatory floodplain, many homes\nnear this area were impacted by the flooding in September 2013. Flooding\nwas determined to be related to diversion from Leyden Creek near ponds,\nfence lines, and other obstructions, as well as overflows from the canal\nsystems located in proximity to Cameo Estates. This area was also\ndetermined to be subject to flooding potential for events exceeding the\n100-year event, such as the September 2013 flood.\n\n\nProblem Area 3B \u2013 West of Cameo Estates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of Cameo Estates, private ponds, fence lines, and other\nobstructions have potential to divert flows towards residential\ndevelopment, away from the natural flow paths. This was evident in\nSeptember 2013.\n\n\nProblem Area 3C \u2013 Croke Canal\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe 36\u201d CMP crossing of Leyden Creek under the Croke Canal is undersized\nleading to flows spilling into the Croke Canal. These comingled flows\nexceed the design capacity of the canal, jeopardizing the structural\nintegrity of the canal. This was experienced with the September 2013\nflooding where the canal bank eroded and eventually breached near West\n78\nth\n Place and Eldridge Street.\n\n\nProblem Area 3D \u2013 Indiana Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEven though it was improved since the 2013 flood, the crossing at\nIndiana Street still remains undersized compared to the 100-year event.\nUpstream of Indiana Street there are two residential homes inundated by\nthe 100-year floodplain.\n\n\n4.2.4 Flood Hazards of Reach 4\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProblem Area 4A \u2013 Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs demonstrated by the updated hydrology in this report, Leyden Lake\novertops during the 100-year and more significant events even though the\noriginal design of this facility was intended to provide 100-year level\nof protection. Flows that are discharged over the Leyden Lake spillway\nmay be intercepted by the Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal and can lead to other\npotential damages.\n\n\nProblem Area 4B \u2013 Church Ditch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Leyden Creek crossing with the Church Ditch lacks capacity to convey\nthe flow without overtopping the canal. The canal embankment was eroded\nduring the September 2013 flood due to the lack of capacity. This\nultimately diverted flows from the Church Ditch into Leyden Lake. No\nstructures are present in the vicinity of the Church Ditch crossing.\n\n\nProblem Area 4C \u2013 Quaker Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe existing crossing at Quaker Street has less than a 2-year capacity,\ncausing excess flows to overtop the road. This lack of conveyance\ncapacity also contributes to the flooding associated with Problem Area\n4D.\n\n\nProblem Area 4D \u2013 Leyden Townsite\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of the Quaker Street crossing, within the Leyden Townsite\nsubdivision, four structures are at risk within the 100-yr regulatory\nfloodplain, including two homes. The source of the flood hazards in the\narea are due to the lack of channel conveyance capacity and the\novertopping at Quaker Street.\n\n\nProblem Area 4E \u2013 Pattridge Open Space\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThrough Pattridge Open Space, steep longitudinal slopes have led to high\nvelocities, causing erosion of the banks of Leyden Creek. As further\ndevelopment occurs upstream and flows increase, grade control is\nwarranted to address future degradation.\n\n\nProblem Area 4F \u2013 West 82\nnd\n Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe culvert crossing at West 82\nnd\n Avenue currently has less than a\n5-year capacity. The City of Arvada would like to maintain 100-year\nconveyance capacity for all major roadway crossings.\n\n\nProblem Area 4G \u2013 Blue Mountain Estates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDuring the September 2013 flood, flows from the Blue Mountain Estates\narea eroded the shoulders of Blue Mountain Road and diverted water into\nthe Leyden Creek watershed. Not only did this require repair from the\nCity of Arvada, but it also limited access to Blue Mountain Estates\nduring the flood. The City of Arvada wishes to maintain a higher level\nof capacity for Blue Mountain Road and reduce the potential for future\ndamages in the area, as seen in the Drainage Problem Area Figures in\n\nAPPENDIX C \u2013 Hydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\n4.3 Previous Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPrevious analysis of the Leyden Creek watershed consists of the\nRalston/Leyden Creek Major Drainageway Planning by Wright-McLaughlin in\n1977 and the Flood Hazard Delineation Ralston Creek \u2013 Leyden Creek in\n2004 by Boyle Engineering. The 1977 MDP identified the road crossings\nthroughout the watershed to be improved from West 82\nnd\n Avenue (Leyden\nRoad in 1977 MDP) to Simms Street. The 2004 FHAD identified the Alkire\nStreet crossing as \u201cinadequately sized to convey more than nuisance\nflows and results in overtopping of the street and shallow flooding to\nthe east of Alkire Street during larger events.\u201d The water surface\nelevations downstream of the Leyden Lake to W 75\nth\n Place have increase\ndue to increased discharges from the dam due to inaccurate elevations\nused in the rating curve in previous studies.",

The addition of alternate regional detention facilities\nwere not considered beyond Leyden Lake. Alternatives were reviewed with\nproject sponsors at periodic project meetings. A separate meeting was\nheld with staff representing the Croke Canal.\n\n\n5.2 Criteria and Constraints\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe design and evaluation of conceptual alternatives was based on the\ncriteria set forth in the Jefferson County Design and Technical Criteria\nStorm Drainage Manual, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual, and City of\nArvada\u2019s Engineering Code of Standards and Specifications.\n\n\nAfter discussion with project sponsors, it was determined that any major\nroadway crossing and each of the local road crossings in the City of\nArvada would be sized to convey the 100-year discharge. The only local\nroad crossing, West 75\nth\n Place in unincorporated Jefferson County,\nwould be evaluated based on current county standards. The applicable\ncounty standards considered for West 75\nth\n Place in the \nJefferson\nCounty Design and Technical Criteria Storm Drainage Manual\n states a\n10-year crossing, less than one foot of overtopping on the roadway, and\na maximum headwater depth to culvert size ratio of 1.5.\n\n\n5.3 Alternative Categories\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProblem areas within the Leyden Creek watershed fell into several\ncategories. The categories that applied to multiple problem areas were:\nChannel Conveyance, Channel Stabilization, and Bridge/Culvert\nalternatives. There were also several categories that were unique to\nspecific problem area including Culvert/Spill Structure for the canal\ncrossings, and Detention Alternatives at Leyden Lake. An alternative\nfeasibility matrix for each problem area can be seen in \nTable 5\u20111\n.\n\n\n5.3.1 Channel Conveyance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nChannel conveyance alternatives were developed in areas that were\nidentified to pose flood hazards due to a lack in channel conveyance\ncapacity. Increasing capacity in these areas will better manage the\nflood hazards surrounding buildings and other structures.\n\n\n5.3.2 Channel Stabilization\n\uf0c1\n\n\nChannel stabilization alternatives were developed to address areas with\npotential for future channel degradation and bank erosion. Check\nstructures have been proposed as a means to control future erosion along\nthe drainageway. Design channel slopes of 0.6% upstream of Leyden Lake\nand 0.45% downstream of Leyden Lake were selected based on a combination\nof criteria set forth in \nUrban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual\n and\nrecommendations for the project area based on previous reports.\n\n\n5.3.3 Bridge / Culverts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThrough discussions with project sponsors, any major roadway crossings,\nand all roadway crossings within the City of Arvada were sized to convey\nthe 100-year flow without overtopping the roadway. The crossing at West\n75\nth\n Place, within unincorporated Jefferson County would be evaluated\nbased on county roadway crossing criteria.\n\n\nWard Road, located in Reach 2, is planned to extend north from the\nintersection with West 72\nnd\n Avenue, crossing Leyden Creek between West\n75\nth\n Avenue and West 75\nth\n Place. The current conceptual design for\nWard Road call for a six cell 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC crossing at Leyden\nCreek. Since planning for the Ward Road extension is proceeding\nindependently from this project, separate design alternatives and\nproject alternative costs have not been included with this plan. The\nWard Road extension also includes extending the trail from Leyden Creek\nPark up to Alkire Street with a separate trail underpass for Ward Road,\nlocated south of the Ward Road and Leyden Creek crossing. The trail\ncrosses underneath of Alkire Street at the proposed new intersection of\nAlkire Street and West 78\nth\n Circle, separate from Leyden Creek itself.\n\n\nFor these reasons, the trail crossing culverts at the proposed Ward Road\nextension and Alkire Street have not been include in the project design\nalternatives, as these improvements are offline and in their current\nconfiguration not directly associated with the proposed Leyden Creek\ninfrastructures needs. Conversely, recreational needs including a\nmaintenance trail would be considered with the project design\nalternatives in areas such as Quaker Street and West 72md Avenue.\n\n\n5.3.4 Culvert / Spill Structure\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCanal crossings were evaluated to develop alternatives to prevent the\ndamage witnessed in the September 2013 flooding. Representatives for the\ncanals were contacted to determine their interest in developing\nalternatives with the project team. A meeting was held with staff\nrepresenting the Croke Canal discussing the preferred alternatives at\nthe Leyden Creek crossing. Flow limiting structures were discussed to\nprevent exceeding the decreed flow of the Croke Canal downstream of the\ncrossing. Since the Croke Canal requires two feet of freeboard, the\nproject team decided to develop alternatives for Leyden Creek crossing\nunderneath the existing Croke Canal. The City of Arvada did not express\ninterest in having a purge control structure at the crossing so it was\ndecided a passive weir structure was the best alternative for any type\nof flow limiting structure.\n\n\nThe Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal was discussed in relation to alternatives\ndeveloped at Leyden Lake. The Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal intercepts any\nflows passing over the Leyden Lake emergency spillway. If Leyden Lake\nwas improved to a 100-year storage facility, there would be no impact on\nthe Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal, as the principal spillway passes\nunderneath the canal.\n\n\nPlans for a new crossing of the Church Ditch at Leyden Creek are also\nunderway, following the 2013 flood event. Similar to the Ward Road\nextension, no additional alternatives were developed for this location.\n\n\n5.3.5 Detention Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLeyden Lake was evaluated to determine the necessary improvements to\ndetain the 100-yr storm without overtopping the emergency spillway. The\nhydrologic benefits of this improvement were also discussed.\n\n\n5.4 Alternative Hydraulics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nHydraulic analyses were performed to evaluate the benefits and impact of\neach alternative. In general, channel conveyance was based on the normal\ndepth sizes and shapes for cross-sectional areas required to convey the\ndesign discharges. The hydraulic analysis was performed in accordance\nwith UDFCD, City of Arvada, and Jefferson County criteria. Each\nalternative was analyzed separately and inserted into the existing\nconditions HEC-RAS v4.1.0 model to gage its impact on the floodplain.\n\n\nSizing for roadway box culverts were estimated using the nomographs\nfound in the USDCM.\n\n\nEPA SWMM was used to evaluate the hydrology alternative of Leyden Lake.\n\n\n5.5 Alternative Cost Estimates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCost estimates for alternatives were developed using UDFCD\u2019s master\nplanning cost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. 2012 unit\ncosts values were adjusted to present value using the current Colorado\nConstruction Cost Index report. An inflation rate of 1.0804 was used to\nadjust unit costs. A summary of unit costs can be found in \nAPPENDIX C \u2013\nHydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\nEffective interest rate was estimated to be 1.50%. This assumption was\nmade based upon current discount rates from the Federal Reserve Discount\nWindow and inflation rates published by the US government. These figures\ncan be found in \nAPPENDIX C \u2013 Hydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\nOperation and Maintenance was also included within the UD MP Cost\nworksheet. Culvert maintenance was assumed to occur once every two\nyears, with hydraulic structure and channel maintenance performed once\nevery five years.\n\n\nRight of way easement costs were calculated using data from the\nJefferson County Assessor\u2019s Office. The easement value was proportioned\nfrom the total assessed property value. If an easement required more\nthan 50 percent of the property, the entire assessed value was used in\nthe easement cost.\n\n\nOther costs were calculated as a percent of Capital Improvement Costs,\nsuch as Engineering, Legal/Administrative, Contract\nAdministration/Construction Management, and Contingency. No alterations\nto the default values provided by the UD-MP Cost spreadsheet were made\nto these items.\n\n\nTable \u2011: Alternative Pre-Screening Matrix\n\n\n5.6 Alternative Plans\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSeveral different alternative plans were developed to mitigate problem\nareas throughout the watershed. One alternative plan, Minimum Crossing\nImprovement and Maintenance Alternatives, improves all roadway crossings\nto meet current jurisdictional criteria. The second alternative plan,\n100-year Conveyance Alternative, improves roadway crossings to convey\n100-year flows at all locations and increases channel conveyance\ncapacity in problem areas. Isolated alternatives were also evaluated for\ndetention, and slope stabilization. A summary of alternative cost\nestimates can be seen in \nTable 5\u20112\n through \nTable 5\u20114\n.\n\n\n5.6.1 Reach 1\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of the confluence with Ralston Creek to Simms Street, no\nalternatives were developed since no flood hazards were identified in\nthis area. The roadway crossing at Simms Street has adequate capacity to\nconvey the 100-yr design discharge.\n\n\nUpstream of Simms Street, alternatives were developed to address the\novertopping at West 72\nnd\n Avenue and flooding within the Woodland\nValley Filing No. 3 subdivision along with the undersized roadway\ncrossing at West 72\nnd\n Avenue. Both alternatives address the inundation\nof structures caused by the split flow at West 72\nnd\n Avenue.\n\n\nPlan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis alternative will divert flows upstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue using\na 11 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC. This culvert will continue east along West 72\nnd\n\nAvenue, and south through the First Church of Arvada\u2019s parking lot,\nprior to discharging back into Leyden Creek just upstream of the Simms\nStreet crossing. The RCBC is sized for approximately 500 cfs, the flow\nestimated to be beyond the current channel capacity downstream of West\n72\nnd\n Avenue. West 72\nnd\n Avenue will also be increased in size to a 70\nft. bridge to convey the remaining 1657 cfs across the roadway.\n\n\nPlan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe 100-yr Conveyance Alternative proposes to improve the roadway\ncrossing and existing channel to convey the entire 100-year design\ndischarge along the existing flowpath. This alternative requires\nacquiring right of way easements in several properties in the Woodland\nValley Filing No. 3 subdivision as the existing channel doesn\u2019t have the\ncapacity to convey the 100-year design discharge. The required\nright-of-way for these improvements is approximately 90 feet. The West\n72\nnd\n Avenue Bridge will be increased to a 90 ft. bridge to convey the\nentire 100-year discharge of 2157 cfs. Acquiring the right-of-way for\nthe proposed channel would also increase the area available to\nincorporate a future trail and trail underpass, between West 72\nnd\n\nAvenue and the existing trail downstream of Simms Street.\n\n\nUpstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, in the Woodland Valley No. 7\nsubdivision, increasing the existing channel conveyance capacity is\nproposed to eliminate the right bank spill flow that currently impacts\nresidential homes.\n\n\n5.6.2 Reach 2\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe alternatives developed for Reach 2 proposed to mitigate the\nundersized roadway crossings at West 75\nth\n Place and Alkire Street\ndesigned to meet criteria identified in Section \n5.3.3 Bridge /\nCulverts\n. There are several structures within the regulatory floodplain\nand additional structures in the shallow flooding areas. All\nalternatives developed for Reach 2 eliminate the shallow flooding that\nflows across Alkire Street.\n\n\nPlan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDouble 8 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are proposed beneath West 75\nth\n Place to\nincrease the capacity of the crossing to meet the Jefferson County\ncriteria. This plan would not be impacted by the Ward Road expansion\nsince the proposed improvements tie into the existing channel upstream\nof the proposed Ward Road crossing.\n\n\nAt Alkire Street, the existing crossing is proposed to be improved as\ntwo 12 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC\u2019s. Channel work is proposed at both locations to\nlower the channel upstream and downstream of each crossing. At Alkire\nStreet, the existing water features upstream of the culvert crossing\nwill require some degree of reconstruction to accommodate the proposed\nchannel grades.\n\n\nPlan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis alternative proposes to convey the 100-yr discharge from Alkire\nStreet to downstream of West 75\nth\n Place within a new design channel,\nparalleling the existing channel alignment. The new channel will\nmitigate 100-year floodplain impacts at existing structures along this\nreach and convey 100-year flood flows below both Alkire Street and West\n75\nth\n Place. The roadway crossing at West 75\nth\n Place is proposed to\nbe improved to double 14 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC to convey the 100-yr discharge\nunder the roadway. Additional consideration would be needed during\nconceptual design to address the proposed channel improvements near the\nWard Road expansion.\n\n\nPlan 3: Combination Alternate\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA third alternative was developed incorporating aspects of both Plan 1\nand Plan 2. The proposed crossing structure at Alkire Street and the\nproposed channel from Plan 2 are carried forward to Plan 3, but the\ncrossing at West 75\nth\n Place is sized to meet the minimum\njurisdictional criteria conveying the 10-year discharge. By downsizing\nthe culvert at West 75\nth\n Place to meet the minimum local road\njurisdictional criteria, the proposed channel downstream of West 75\nth\n\nPlace requires less disturbance to property owners by tying into the\nexisting channel grade in less distance than Plan 2. Similar to Plan 1,\nthe future Ward Road crossing with Leyden Creek would not be impacted by\nthis alternative.\n\n\n5.6.3 Reach 3\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPlan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPlan 1 proposes to convey the 10-yr discharge under the Croke Canal via\ntwo 8 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC\u2019s. Any flows that exceeded the 10-yr discharge\nwould comingle with the decreed Croke Canal flow and overflow back into\nLeyden Creek through a passive weir spillway. The spillway on the\ndownstream embankment diverts any flows in excess of the decreed flow\nback into Leyden Creek. Formalization of the passive weir structure will\nneed to meet canal district approval.\n\n\nAt Indiana Street, a 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC is proposed to convey the\n100-yr discharge below the roadway.\n\n\nPlan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo address flows with the potential to spill from Leyden Creek, west of\nCameo Estates, an overflow channel has been proposed to add overall\nfloodplain capacity. Low frequency flows would continue along the\nexisting Leyden Creek alignment while the overflow diversion channel\nwould convey flows with potential to cause flooding away from the\npossible flooding areas.\n\n\nAt the Croke Canal crossing (3) 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC\u2019s are proposed to\nconvey the entire 100-yr discharge under the Croke Canal. By conveying\nthe 100-yr discharge under the canal, the comingling of Leyden Creek and\nthe Croke Canal would be minimized, eliminating the need for the weir\nspillway.\n\n\nThe 100-year crossing at Indiana Street proposed in Plan 1 is carried\nforward to this alternative.\n\n\nPlan 3: Combination Alternate\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPlan 3 proposes to convey the 100-yr discharge under the Croke Canal\nwith (3) 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC as proposed in Plan 2 in addition to the\npassive weir spillway. By spilling any flows in excess of the 100-year\ndischarge at this location, the canal downstream is protected by\nlimiting the canal to the decreed flow. The diversion channel proposed\ndownstream of the Croke Canal in Plan 3 is increased in size to convey\nevents larger than the 100-year, such as the event in September 2013.\nThe channel was sized to accommodate the peak flow witnessed downstream\nof Leyden Lake in September 2013, reported in the Water & Earth\nTechnologies report of 1,351 cfs. This flow is more than double the\n100-yr design discharge of 665 cfs at this location.\n\n\nAlthough 100-year flood hazards have not been identified for the Cameo\nEstates No. 1 subdivision, the flooding in September 2013 impacted many\nhomes in this area. Overbank grading is proposed south of Cameo Estates\nto add capacity to the current floodplain for flows in excess of the\n100-year event.\n\n\n5.6.4 Reach 4\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNo alternatives were developed for the Leyden Creek crossing with the\nChurch Ditch. Following the breach of the canal in September 2013,\nEcological Resource Consultants, Inc. and SM&RC Structural Engineers\nInc. prepared construction drawings for a new crossing to be\nconstructed.\n\n\nPlan 1: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo convey the 100-year design discharge under Quaker Street, five 10 ft.\nx 8 ft. RCBC\u2019s are proposed to convey the flow with no overtopping.\nUpstream in Pattridge Open Space, check structures implemented\nthroughout this reach would stabilize the longitudinal channel slope\npreventing any further channel degradation. At West 82\nnd\n Avenue, a\nfive cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC crossing is proposed to prevent\novertopping of the roadway.\n\n\nAt Blue Mountain Road, alternatives were developed to prevent\novertopping during the 100-yr design storm. Plan 1 proposes to\nreconstruct and elevate Blue Mountain Road allowing two 8 ft. x 6 ft.\nRCBC\u2019s to be installed under Blue Mountain Road along the historic flow\npath. One of the RCBC would replace the existing culvert with the other\nstructure located further southeast to collect flows that overtop the\nUnion Pacific Railroad embankment. A grouted boulder structure is\nproposed to divert the overtopping railroad flows into the proposed\nRCBC.\n\n\nPlan 2: 100-year Conveyance Alternative\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis plan includes an alternative to detain the 100-year flows in Leyden\nLake without overtopping of the emergency spillway. This alternative\nwould require raising the spillway crest and dam embankment\napproximately one foot. Although these improvements reduce the discharge\nout of Leyden Lake from 665 cfs to 224 cfs, this alternative had no\nimpact on the sizes of roadway crossings downstream of Leyden Lake.\nBasins tributary to the Indiana Street crossing produce a peak flow of\n663 cfs, independent of any improvements made to Leyden Lake.\n\n\nBy implementing the crossing structure at Quaker Street from Plan 1 in\naddition to increasing the channel capacity throughout Leyden Townsite,\nthe floodplain can be removed from structures not mitigated with Plan 1.\n\n\nA five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC will convey the 100-year discharge under\nWest 82\nnd\n Avenue. A new channel alignment is proposed removing the\nexisting trailhead from the floodplain.\n\n\nAt Blue Mountain Road, Plan 2 proposes to eliminate all overtopping of\nthe railroad embankment by installing a second 72\u201d CMP pipe through the\nrailroad embankment. On the downstream side of the embankment two 8 ft.\nx 6 ft. RCBC will convey the flow under Blue Mountain Road.\n\n\nTable \u2011: Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nTable \u2011: 100-yr Conveyance Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nTable \u2011: Combination Alternative Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nCI&M 1\n\n\nFigure \u2011: Alternative Plans: Minimum Crossing Improvements and Maintenance\n\n\nCrossing Improvement 2\n\n\nFigure \u2011: Alternative Plans: 100-yr Conveyance\n\n\n100yr conveyance 2\n\n\nFigure \u2011: Alternative Plans: Combination Alternative\n\n\n5.7 Qualitative Evaluation Procedure\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA benefit cost analysis was completed for the Leyden Townsite, Indiana,\nAlkire, and Woodland Valley No. 7 proposed project locations. FEMA\u2019s\nBenefit Cost Analysis (BCA) Tool, version 5.0.0.0, was used to calculate\nflood mitigation benefits for structures within the project areas.\nStructure size and type were taken from the Jefferson County parcel\ndata. First floor elevations were estimated from the 1ft project\nmapping. Additional assumptions used in the BCA calculations include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigated 10-, 50-, and 100-year water surface elevation set to 2.2, 2.1, and 2.0 feet below first floor elevation respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigated 500-year water surface elevation set to 0.5 feet lower than pre-mitigation elevation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding replacement value (BRV) was set at \\$117/sf for residential structures and reduced by 50%, or \\$60/sf for barns and greenhouses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject useful life set at 30 years for all projects, per culvert projects using BCA guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard FEMA library damage curves were used for each structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on a comparison of reported structure size and aerial footprint size, all structures were assumed to not have basements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll foundations were assumed to be slab on grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre mitigation water surface elevations, channel elevations, and discharges taken from effective hydraulic models and interpolated for structures between cross sections as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent worth of damages were totaled for the structures impacted at\neach proposed project to determine benefits of each project. The total\nbenefit was then divided by the project cost in order to estimate the\nbenefit cost ratio.

FEMA\u2019s\nBenefit Cost Analysis (BCA) Tool, version 5.0.0.0, was used to calculate\nflood mitigation benefits for structures within the project areas.\nStructure size and type were taken from the Jefferson County parcel\ndata. First floor elevations were estimated from the 1ft project\nmapping. Additional assumptions used in the BCA calculations include:    Mitigated 10-, 50-, and 100-year water surface elevation set to 2.2, 2.1, and 2.0 feet below first floor elevation respectively.    Mitigated 500-year water surface elevation set to 0.5 feet lower than pre-mitigation elevation.    Building replacement value (BRV) was set at \\$117/sf for residential structures and reduced by 50%, or \\$60/sf for barns and greenhouses.    Project useful life set at 30 years for all projects, per culvert projects using BCA guidelines.    Standard FEMA library damage curves were used for each structure.    Based on a comparison of reported structure size and aerial footprint size, all structures were assumed to not have basements.    All foundations were assumed to be slab on grade.    Pre mitigation water surface elevations, channel elevations, and discharges taken from effective hydraulic models and interpolated for structures between cross sections as needed.    Present worth of damages were totaled for the structures impacted at\neach proposed project to determine benefits of each project.

            "text": "RECOMMENDED PLAN\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.1 Plan Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe recommended plan, shown in \nFigure 6\u20111\n, is described below.\n\n\n6.1.1 Reach 1 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlthough cost estimates showed the Minimum Crossing Improvement and\nMaintenance alternative to be more expensive, this plan is recommended\nat West 72\nnd\n Avenue. The easements needed to implement the 100-yr\nConveyance Alternative are not feasible given the residential lots in\nthis area.\n\n\nThe channel grading in the Woodland Valley No. 7 subdivision associated\nwith the 100-yr Conveyance Plan is included in the recommended plan. The\nresidential buildings currently in the regulatory 100-year floodplain\ncan be removed by the proposed project.\n\n\n6.1.2 Reach 2 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan is recommended for\nReach 2. While the other two alternative plans remove additional\nbuildings from the floodplain, the additional benefits associated with\nthose alternatives do not justify the added cost. The Minimum Crossing\nImprovement Plan will address the Zone X shaded flood hazard area by\npreventing the spill flows that creates the shallow flooding at Alkire\nStreet. This alternative will not have any impact on the proposed Ward\nRoad expansion trail or roadway crossing at Leyden Creek.\n\n\n6.1.3 Reach 3 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe recommended plan for Reach 3 includes the 100-yr Conveyance Plan\ncrossing structure at Indiana Street and the Croke Canal, but does not\ninclude the overflow channel west of Cameo Estates. The overflow channel\nwas not included as it would not directly mitigate any flood hazards.\n\n\nAt the Croke Canal, the proposed improvement will convey the 100-yr\ndischarge underneath the canal, minimizing the comingling flows,\neliminating the need for the passive weir structure. During final\ndesign, an additional flood control purge structure should be\ninvestigated to determine the feasibility between the City of Arvada and\nthe Croke Canal representatives.\n\n\n6.1.4 Reach 4 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNo improvements are recommended at Leyden Lake. Improving Leyden Lake to\ncontain the 100-yr design storm only impacts a short reach of Leyden\nCreek immediately downstream of the spillway. The first roadway crossing\nat Indiana Street is not affected in size if any improvements to Leyden\nCreek are proposed. Although no roadway crossings would be impacted, the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal would be impacted. Any flows that are\ndischarged over the emergency spillway are intercepted by the Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal. Flows through the primary spillway do not influence the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal.\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan is recommended\nplan for Quaker Street. The benefit cost analysis determined the\nadditional work associated with channelization of Leyden Creek through\nthis stretch was not equivalent to the additional cost. Any trail\ncrossing near Quaker Street will be further evaluated during Conceptual\nDesign.\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative is also\nrecommended at West 82\nnd\n Avenue. The additional benefit of the\n100-year Conveyance alternative is removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain. Since it is not feasible to assume the trailhead would be\nheavily used during the 100-year event, removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain is not a priority.\n\n\nBlue Mountain Road is only access road for Blue Mountain Estates,\ncreating the need to provide access during the 100-year event. After\ncomparing the cost associated with each alternative, the Minimum\nCrossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan was selected for Blue Mountain\nEstates. This plan eliminates roadway overtopping at Blue Mountain\nEstates, and the grouted boulder structure will ensure the majority of\nthe discharge overtopping the railroad will remain tributary to the\nhistoric flow path in the Coal Creek Watershed.\n\n\nThe final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should investigate any\nimpacts to the structures downstream of Blue Mountain Road.\n\n\nTable \u2011: Recommended Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\nTable \u2011: Jurisdictional Cost Estimate Summary\n\n\n6.2 Water Quality Impacts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is no regional water quality improvements proposed for the Leyden\nCreek watershed. New developments, such as Leyden Rock, and Leyden Ranch\nWest, will handle water quality on a site specific basis.\n\n\nEroding channel banks also can lead to degradation in water quality\nthroughout a watershed. By implementing the proposed stable channel\nslopes, less erosion will occur, improving the water quality in the\nwatershed.\n\n\n6.3 Operations and Maintenance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCulvert maintenance for all proposed improvements was assumed to occur\nonce every two years. Channel maintenance for proposed improved\nchannels, and all proposed hydraulic structures was assumed to be\nperformed once every five years.\n\n\n6.4 Environmental and Safety Assessment\n\uf0c1\n\n\nImplementation of the recommended plan will reduce flood hazards at\nselected roadway crossings. These changes will also improve emergency\naccess during flood events. With exception to at 75\nth\n Place, culvert\ncapacity up to the 100-year event has been provided.\n\n\nERO assessed the study area for potential wetlands and waters of the\nU.S., threatened and endangered species, and general wildlife use. Below\nis a summary of the resources found at the study area and\nrecommendations or future actions necessary based on the current site\nconditions and federal, state, and local regulations. ERO\u2019s entire\nassessment can be found in \nAPPENDIX E \u2013 Wetland and Riparian\nInventory\n.\n\n\n6.6.1 General:\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlthough there are some regulated resources in the study area, none of\nthem are unique or regionally important. Aside from potential depletions\nassociated with new water bodies, ERO has not identified any significant\nregulatory constraints on the proposed projects. Because of their\ndynamic natures, site conditions and regulations should be reconfirmed\nby a qualified consultant prior to conducting construction activities\nwithin the watershed.\n\n\n6.6.2 Wetlands and Other Waters of the U.S.\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLeyden Creek, most of its tributaries, and abutting wetlands are likely\nwaters of the U.S. Any activity in the proposed alternatives that would\nrequire placing dredged or fill material into Leyden Creek, tributaries,\nor wetlands must comply with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Many of\nthe activities in the proposed alternatives would provide a net benefit\nto the stream, particularly reestablishing open reaches and grading the\nchannel.\n\n\n6.6.3 Threatened and Endangered Species\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is no suitable habitat present for any listed threatened or\nendangered species, but depletions associated with new water bodies\nwould likely require consultation on potential depletions associated\nwith the water bodies and their potential effects on downstream\nthreatened and endangered species on the Platte River in Nebraska. If\nconstruction activities are likely to take place outside of the Preble\u2019s\nDenver metro block clearance zone, it is recommended that a threatened\nand endangered species letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service be\nsubmitted.\n\n\n6.6.4 Migratory Birds and Other Wildlife\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf any active nests are found in the study area, any work that would\ndestroy the nests should not be conducted until the birds have abandoned\nthe nests. If possible, ground-clearing activities should occur outside\nof the April 1 through August 31 migratory bird breeding season. If\nconstruction activities would occur during the migratory bird breeding\nseason, a nest survey should be conducted immediately prior to\nconstruction.\n\n\nInsert: DS here\n\n\nFigure \u2011:\nRecommended Plan\n\n\nInsert U/S here\n\n\nUpstream recommended plan",

Improving Leyden Lake to\ncontain the 100-yr design storm only impacts a short reach of Leyden\nCreek immediately downstream of the spillway. The first roadway crossing\nat Indiana Street is not affected in size if any improvements to Leyden\nCreek are proposed. Although no roadway crossings would be impacted, the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal would be impacted. Any flows that are\ndischarged over the emergency spillway are intercepted by the Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal. Flows through the primary spillway do not influence the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal.  The Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan is recommended\nplan for Quaker Street. The benefit cost analysis determined the\nadditional work associated with channelization of Leyden Creek through\nthis stretch was not equivalent to the additional cost. Any trail\ncrossing near Quaker Street will be further evaluated during Conceptual\nDesign.  The Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative is also\nrecommended at West 82 nd  Avenue. The additional benefit of the\n100-year Conveyance alternative is removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain. Since it is not feasible to assume the trailhead would be\nheavily used during the 100-year event, removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain is not a priority.  Blue Mountain Road is only access road for Blue Mountain Estates,\ncreating the need to provide access during the 100-year event. After\ncomparing the cost associated with each alternative, the Minimum\nCrossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan was selected for Blue Mountain\nEstates. This plan eliminates roadway overtopping at Blue Mountain\nEstates, and the grouted boulder structure will ensure the majority of\nthe discharge overtopping the railroad will remain tributary to the\nhistoric flow path in the Coal Creek Watershed.  The final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should investigate any\nimpacts to the structures downstream of Blue Mountain Road.
